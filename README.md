# Breast Cancer Detection

## Overview
This project aims to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer detection using machine learning and deep learning techniques on histopathological images and structured data. It compares the efficacy of models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and deep learning models including a custom CNN, ResNet-50, and VGG-16 applied to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and the BreakHis dataset.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes implementations of KNN and SVM.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Uses advanced models like ResNet-50 and VGG-16 and a custom CNN model.
- **Histopathological Image Analysis**: Applies image processing to improve classification accuracy.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-detection.git
```
Ensure Python 3 and necessary libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-Learn are installed.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   cd breast-cancer-detection
   jupyter notebook breast_cancer_detection.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells in the notebook to train the models and see the evaluations.

## Dataset
The project utilizes two main datasets:
- **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**: Features derived from digitized images of breast mass.
- **BreakHis Dataset**: Histopathological images used to train deep learning models.

## Output
The system outputs the classification results indicating the presence of benign or malignant tumors.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the model accuracy and efficiency are welcome. Please ensure to follow the existing code style and add unit tests for any new functionality.
